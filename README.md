## Overview
This repo consists in a simple C application that generates 10 simple math operations (additions, subtractions, multiplications and divisions, with no decimals) without using numbers greater than 100 (except the result of each operation). The goal is to answer these questions using your mind, so using this app frequently could improve your brain or something like that.

By the way, if a division gives a non integer result, you should "floor" your answer (e.g: 5.6666 should be answered as 5).

## Compiling and executing
This is a simple application and you should not have problems compiling it with the typical C compiler (such as GCC). If you execute it from a shell, you can specify the number of questions as the first parameter.

## License
You are completely free to adapt part of the source code to your project.
